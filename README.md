Passbird is an npm library for generating and validating passwords.

# Installation

To install Passbird globally on your system, run:

```sh
npm install -g passbird
```

To install Passbird in an specific context, run:

```sh
npm install passbird
```

# Usage (when installed globally)

To use Passbird, start by running:

```sh
passbird start
```

You will be asked to choose the type of password you want to generate:

```sh
$ passbird start
? Want to generate a default or memorable password or want to validate a password? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Default
  Memorable
  Validate
```

## Default Password

If you choose the "Default" option, you will be asked the following questions:

```sh
? What type of password do you want to generate? Default
? How long do you want the password to be? 10
? Include uppercase letters? Yes
? Include numbers? Yes
? Include symbols? Yes
```
After answering these questions, Passbird will generate a random password for you, like this: :v/rz!p6SR

## Memorable Password

If you choose the "Memorable" option, you will be asked the following questions:

```sh
? What type of password do you want to generate? Memorable
? Include uppercase letters? Yes
? Include numbers? Yes
? Include symbols? Yes
Please, enter the words separated by commas: Andr√©s, Lina
```
After answering these questions, Passbird will generate a memorable password for you, like this: Andr√©sdLina16M.. If you're not satisfied with the password, you can choose to generate a new one:

```sh
Are you satisfied with the password? (y/n) n
Please, enter the words separated by commas:
```

## Validate

This section of the code introduces a feature that validates any given password against the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API.

```sh
$ passbird start
? Want to generate a default or memorable password or want to validate a password? Validate
? Insert password to validate: Loi

Warn:
Password has been exposed in previous data breaches.
```

# Usage (when installed in an specific context)

If you want to use an specific function (default, memorable or validate password), run:

## For default:

```sh
node default.js <length> <includeUppercase> <includeNumbers> <includeSymbols>
```

The command will be something like:

```sh
node default.js 10 true true true
```

If you want to import it and use it in your project:

```sh
import { generatDefaultePassword } from '../node_modules/passbird/src/index.js';

// Define arguments
let length = 10;
let includeUppercase = 'true';
let includeNumbers = 'true';
let includeSymbols = 'true';

// Call the function
let password = generatDefaultePassword(length, includeUppercase, includeNumbers, includeSymbols);
```

## For memorable:

```sh
node memorable.js <includeUppercase> <includeNumbers> <includeSymbols>
```

The command will be something like:

```sh
node memorable.js true true true
```
Then, you will be ask for write the words you want to use.

If you want to import it and use it in your project:

```sh
import { generateMemorablePassword } from '../node_modules/passbird/src/index.js';

// Define arguments
let includeUppercase = 'true';
let includeNumbers = 'true';
let includeSymbols = 'true';

// Call the function
generateMemorablePassword(includeUppercase, includeNumbers, includeSymbols);
```

## For validate:

```sh
node validate.js <password>
```

The command will be something like:

```sh
node validate.js password123
```

If you want to import it and use it in your project:

```sh
import { validatePassword } from '../node_modules/passbird/src/index.js';

// Define the password
let password = 'password123';

// Call the function
validatePassword(password);
```

Note that default.js and memorable.js return the variable "password", so you can use it in your project but validate.js returns a message if the password is breached or not.
