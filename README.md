Passbird is an npm library for generating and validating passwords.

## Installation

To install Passbird globally on your system, run:

## Usage

To use Passbird, start by running:

```

You will be asked to choose the type of password you want to generate:

```sh
$ passbird start
? Want to generate a default or memorable password or want to validate a password? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Default
  Memorable
  Validate
```

## Default Password

If you choose the "Default" option, you will be asked the following questions:

```sh
? What type of password do you want to generate? Default
? How long do you want the password to be? 10
? Include uppercase letters? Yes
? Include numbers? Yes

```
After answering these questions, Passbird will generate a random password for you, like this: :v/rz!p6SR

After answering these questions, Passbird will generate a memorable password for you, like this: Andr√©sdLina16M.. If you're not satisfied with the password, you can choose to generate a new one:

```sh
Are you satisfied with the password? (y/n) n
Please, enter the words separated by commas:
